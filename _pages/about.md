I am a DPhil (PhD) student of the [Torr Vision Group](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~tvg/), [University of Oxford](http://www.ox.ac.uk/), supervised by Professor [Philip Torr](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~phst/) and Professor [Victor Prisacariu](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~victor/).
I received my M.Phil. degree from [the University of Sydney](https://sydney.edu.au/), where I was with the [SIGMA Lab](https://sigmalab-usyd.github.io/), [School of Electrical & Information Engineering](https://sydney.edu.au/engineering/about/school-of-electrical-and-information-engineering.html), supervised by Professor [Wanli Ouyang](https://wlouyang.github.io). I am fortunate to collaborate closely with [Weijun Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xUoSmEsAAAAJ&hl=en), and [Liang-Chieh Chen](http://liangchiehchen.com/) at [Google Research](https://research.google/), [Vladlen Koltun](http://vladlen.info/), [Philipp Krähenbühl](https://www.philkr.net/) and [René Ranftl](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cwKg158AAAAJ&hl=en) at Intel ISL. I received a B.Eng. degree in 2016 in Software Engineering from [Wuhan University](http://www.whu.edu.cn/), China. My current focus is on building a comprehensive visual system with a unified perception.
